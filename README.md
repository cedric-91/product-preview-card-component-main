## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Not much on what I've learnt, but what I've used. I used grid instead of flex, for article to split the content into two columns. Which it's a little bit unusual as I usually use flex for these type of layouts.

### Continued development

Will continue to use HTML5 sematic (for accessibility) along with Tailwind css, in my future projects.
